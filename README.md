# Foundry Documents

This is a collection of documents (our EULA and business documents) that we use in running XYZ Type. We are sharing these with the community as things that one can look at use at one’s discretion. These documents may be well suited for you, or they may not. All we can say is that they work for us.

We highly recommend that you have a lawyer you trust look at them if you use them, changes or not. (sidenote: do not be surprised if this leads you into a larger re-working than you intended, our experience is that lawyers like to re-write documents in their preferred style.) 

There are currently two folders: EULA and Business_docs. The EULA folder has, surprisingly, our EULA documents. The Business_docs folder just has our contract for the distribution of fonts by our foundry; it tries to strike a fair balance of foundry and designer’s rights.

All these documents are provided under a Creative Commons CC0 license. You are free to use these documents, no attribution needed. However, **we are not lawyers, and nothing is legal advice. We strongly suggest that you have a lawyer review them to ensure they say what you think they say. These are freely provided for the community; there is no warranty implied, given, or stated. Likewise, we disclaim any liability arising from using these documents.**

**Note:** These documents have XXXX in them for things that you need to fill in for your use, please search for them!

These documents were developed for us by Bryan Wasetis of (Aspect Law Group)[https://www.aspectlg.com] (EULAs) and Elizabeth Clark of (EAS Management)[https://www.easmgmt.com] (distribution agreement).
