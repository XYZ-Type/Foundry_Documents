## Web Addendum

This Web Addendum is incorporated into the Agreement if You selected and paid for web fonts rights in the Order Invoice, and provides additional rights for the License by allowing You to use the Fonts as self-hosted web fonts, hosted on the domain stated when you downloaded the Fonts, to style HTML and SVG documents using the CSS @font-face mechanism. We grant You under the License the additional rights stated in this addendum. Any process, technique or device such as hot-linking, re-serving or re-directing that allows access to and/or use of the Fonts by unlicensed parties is strictly prohibited.

a\. **Editable Use**. The use of the Fonts for web forms is permitted. However, any other editable use of the Fonts, such as in templates or for use in the creation of customizable designs or products requires the purchase of a separate license.

b\. **Third-Party Use**. This License does not extend to third parties. If You are using the Fonts for the creation of a website not owned by You, You or the owner of the website must purchase appropriate licenses to cover their use of the Fonts. You are responsible for any liability arising from Your inclusion of Fonts in websites or other platforms or materials not owned by You.

c\. **Changing Domain**. If You wish to change the domain that the web fonts are used on, You must notify Us via email prior to changing the domain (XXX). There is no charge for changing the domain. The new domain must be owned by the same licensee on the Order Invoice. The License will transfer to the new domain after We notify You of the approved change request.

d\. **Subdomains**. You may use the Fonts on subdomains of the licensed domain.

e\. **Employee-based License Price**. The price of the License is determined based on the total number of people, including temporary workers, simultaneously employed by You, the owner of the website, at the time of purchase. If Your number of employees increases to more than XXXX% of the number listed on your Order Invoice, You must purchase an upgraded license from Us or discontinue use of the Fonts.
