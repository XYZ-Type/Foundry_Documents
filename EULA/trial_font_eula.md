# Trial Font Software End-User License Agreement (EULA)

Please read this agreement before installing or using the font software described in the Order Invoice (collectively “the Fonts”) and owned, licensed, or distributed by XXXX (“We”, “Us” or “Our”). This Font Software End-User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is an agreement between Us and the party stated in the Order Invoice (“You” or “Your”) and governs what You can and cannot do with the Fonts. By installing, copying, or using any portion of the Fonts, You accept and agree to this Agreement. If You do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use or complete the installation of the Fonts.

The Fonts are licensed, not sold. Obtaining a license to the Fonts gives You the right to use the Fonts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the order invoice You received when You purchased the License (the “Order Invoice”). The Order Invoice is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.


## 1\. GRANT OF TRIAL LICENSE

This Agreement grants You a non-exclusive license to use the Fonts on a free trial or paid trial basis after Our receipt of Your payment if applicable and as specified in this Agreement and in the Order Invoice. A “Trial Basis” means use of the Fonts for: (i) testing, evaluation, and comparison purposes; (ii) noncommercial, academic projects; or (iii) private pitches and proposals for Your clients. Your license is limited to the Trial Basis uses and specifications as stated in this Agreement (“Permitted Uses”). Any other use requires a separate license from Us. The term is perpetual if not stated in the Order Invoice. The territory is worldwide if not stated in the Order Invoice. This non-exclusive license does not preclude Our right to license the Fonts to other users.

***If you are uncertain whether your intended use fits within the definition of “Trial Basis,” please contact us prior to using the fonts. If you decide to continue using the fonts beyond the initial evaluation usage or to use them for other reasons, please purchase the appropriate license from us at XXXX.***

Upon Our receipt of payment for the Order Invoice, We grant You a nonexclusive, royalty free, nonassignable, nonsublicensable, and revocable license to use the Fonts for and subject to the Permitted Uses (“License”), provided that You: (i) shall not transfer, give access to, or distribute any part of any Fonts to any third party without Our prior written consent; (ii) shall not attempt in any way to emulate, mimic, or otherwise create a substitute for any Fonts, including outlining; and (iii) comply with this Agreement. We may revoke this License if you breach this Agreement.

If You are a business entity obtaining the License for use by Your owners, employees, agents, or other representatives, You shall notify the representatives of the terms of this Agreement and ensure that such representatives abide by this Agreement.
