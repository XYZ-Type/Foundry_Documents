## Desktop Addendum

This Desktop Addendum is incorporated into the Agreement if You selected and paid for desktop rights in the Order Invoice, and provides additional rights for the License by allowing You to use the Fonts as a desktop font. We grant You under the License the additional rights stated in this addendum. This License may only be used by You on computers You own and only up to the number of users specified in the Order Invoice.

a\. **User**. The License under the Desktop Addendum is restricted to the number of users indicated in Your Order Invoice. Additional users require a new Order Invoice. All users must belong to the same business or household licensing the Fonts. A user may install the fonts on as many computers and/or devices as they have personal control over. You are responsible for the actions of the users and for ensuring their compliance with this Agreement.

b\. **Document Embedding**. You and Your users may embed the Fonts into electronic documents for use on computers that are controlled by You provided that the electronic documents are for personal or internal business use. The Fonts may be embedded into electronic documents (including so-called “e-books” and other “e-publications”) for use on computers that are not controlled by You only if the electronic documents are distributed in a secure format that allows only printing and viewing, and prohibits editing, enhancing, extracting, or modifying the text (hereafter “View and Print Use”). If You are unable to limit access to View and Print Use only, then You shall not permit the electronic document to be used on computers that are not controlled by You. Without the purchase of an additional license(s), You may not embed the Fonts into software or devices, except as defined above. For example, except as defined above, the Fonts may not be embedded into Your: hardware, software, or any editable files that may be accessed by computers that are not controlled by You.

c\. **Font Server Installation**. You may install the Fonts on a computer file server for the purpose of using the Fonts through commands, data or instructions from another computer using the same server, provided that: (i) You shall exclusively control access to the server; (ii) You shall prevent access to the server by third parties other than Your users; and (iii) the number of users with access to the served Fonts does not exceed the number of users specified in the Order Invoice.

d\. **Server-Based Design Software**. You may upload the Fonts to server-based design software that restricts the use of the Fonts to Your account. You shall not include the Fonts in a template that is sold or distributed outside of Your organization. Your license must cover the number of Users using the Fonts, including those with access to the server-based design software.

e\. **Logo Use**. You are permitted to use the Fonts to create logos or brand identities.

f\. **Modifications**. Modification to “outlined” vector files (for example, when using the Fonts to create a logo) is permitted.

g\. **No Software Embedding**. Without the purchase of an additional license, You may not embed the Fonts into software or devices. For example, the Fonts may not be embedded into Your: hardware, software, or any editable files that may be accessed by unlicensed parties.

h\. **Broadcast use**. Usage for broadcast is allowed by this Desktop Addendum as stated here. You are permitted to use the Fonts to create titles and graphics for broadcast media such as film and television and are granted worldwide broadcasting rights to graphics made with the Fonts on all broadcast media, including film and television.
