EULAs

Our EULAs are structured as a base document that sets forth most of the common language, and then each license type is an addendum to the base document. This allows for a much more compact document that can be flexible for a client’s usage.

All EULAs reflect how a foundry wants to do business, and these are no exception. We allow things that you may not want to do and vice versa. Think of this as a template that you can use and edit.

In particular, five items are worth calling out: 
1. The EULA language assumes that an “Order Invoice” will be provided with the fonts/EULA. That invoice should list the fonts licensed, the license types, and who licensed the fonts.
2. We allow broadcast usage in our EULA without a separate addendum. It is part of the desktop license. If you don’t want that, delete item *h.*
3. We allow modifications to our fonts. This allows for things like subsetting web fonts/variable fonts not to break the license and for users to make adjustments if needed. We **do not** provide support for modified fonts and see this permission as something that could lead to non-ideal situations (we like our kerning—we likely won’t like someone’s modified kerning/glyphs). Still, we are also trying to be less precious about things. If you don’t want this, delete 2.b. in the base.md file, and re-letter the items.
4. There are two documents for the Desktop addendum. One allows a desktop license to be used for EPUBS, and the other one does not. We used to allow EPUB use in our desktop fonts but then decided with our new EULA to make EPUB an addendum. We are providing both because it was hard for us to choose, and we have both.
5. We use users for the desktop addendum metric and company size for web/app/epub/etc. addendums. In the clause that defines what we mean by company size, there is a bit about what happens if a company grows over a certain percentage. This may be different from how you want to define things, give it consideration and edit as needed.

You likely should read our customer facing [license article](https://xyztype.com/articles/licensing_our_fonts) to understand all our thinking (and read the [EULAs](https://xyztype.com/eula/desktop) on our site to also see our TL;DR sections).

Are these documents still pretty 'legalese'? Yes. We tried to make them more plain language but landed here out of trying to make something that we felt safe and legally defensible. In that vein, to be very clear: 
> **We are not lawyers, and none of these documents are legal advice. You are free to use these documents, but we strongly suggest that you have a lawyer review them to ensure they say what you think they say. These are freely provided for the community; there is no warranty implied, given, or stated. Likewise, we disclaim any liability arising from using these documents.**
